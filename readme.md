# Percona XtraDB Cluster (PXC) Demo

Quickly get a [Percona XtraDB Cluster](http://www.percona.com/software/percona-xtradb-cluster) cluster up and running with [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) & some shell magic. The base OS is Centos 6.4 x86_64.

You'll also get an HAProxy node which will round-robin connect you to any of the three nodes configured for HA failover. Go ahead, kill -9 a server with a loop running in the background -- you'll have about 2 seconds of potential down time.

Once vargrant has finished provisioning, the network diagram will look like this:

```
           host:8080 ───> haproxy:80    ┌───> m1:3306
           host:3306 ───> haproxy:3306 ─┼───> m2:3306
cc:80 <─── host:9090                    ├───> m3:3306
                                        └───> mN:3306*	
```

\* You can have up to 9 nodes. By default this kicks off 5 -- you can modify the `Vagrantfile` to easily spin up more/less

## Get'er'done

 1. Install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)
 2. Clone this repo
 3. `vagrant up`

## After Startup

The HAProxy node will come up first and you can watch http://127.0.0.1:8080/haproxy/stats -- it'll be a bit boring right up to the point where m1 comes online and you see it go green in the status board.

`pxcstats:secret` for login

Once m2 is up, you can start using your favorite mysql client to connect to 127.0.0.1:3306 with the userpass of `cu` and `cu` to the `clusterup` database. Note how you don't have to wait for m3 to come up, neat :D 

If you `vagrant ssh ha` you'll find that sysbench 0.5 has been installed and you can use it to run the OLTP test against the cluster.

## Notes/TODOs

 - Cluster Control (cc) is a WIP getting a host for that setup and provisioned. Should be a fun item.
 - CHAOS MONKIES!
 - Totes' not safe for a real production deployment (Vagrant boxes come with a publicly known SSH keypair.)
